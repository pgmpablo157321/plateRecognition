# plateRecognition

The goal of this project is to make a simple script that is capable of recognizing colombian car plates in a somewhat controlled enviroment

## Setup
You can run quickly the proyect in just 4 steps:
1. clone the git-hub proyect
2. get the image of the plate you want to recognize, here is an example I found online <a>https://i.pinimg.com/originals/b8/33/af/b833afdfa6d050543117a76aa95dbd9c.jpg</a>
3. set the variable path in the file integration/script.py or integration/quick_run.py to the path of your image (if you are going to use the example linked above it works better with quick_run.py)
4. Since this is a very quick proyect I have not documented dependencies but you need to have numpy, pandas, opencv and scikit-learn
5. run the python script with python3 and done!
